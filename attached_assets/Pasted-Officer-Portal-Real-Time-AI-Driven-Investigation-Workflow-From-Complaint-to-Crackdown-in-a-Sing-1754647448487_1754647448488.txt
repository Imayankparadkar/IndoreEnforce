Officer Portal – Real-Time AI-Driven Investigation Workflow
“From Complaint to Crackdown – in a Single Flow”

✅ 🌐 Overview:
This portal is the operational brain of Project Prahaar 360 – Indore Edition, designed specifically for Cyber Crime Units to:

Visualize complaints in real-time

Launch live AI-engaged sting operations

Analyze scammers’ digital identity footprint

Perform rapid UPI-based takedown

Log all actions immutably via blockchain

📊 🧭 Six-Step Cyber Investigation & Takedown Workflow
🔹 Step 1: REPORT – Prahaar Kavach (The Shield)
A user from Indore (e.g., Priya) sees a suspicious Army ad online.

She becomes skeptical and opens the Prahaar Kavach mobile/web app.

Quick Report Form:

Fields: Phone number, conversation screenshots, scam type (dropdown), optional audio.

Once submitted, the complaint:

Is automatically scored for urgency (e.g., scam type + history of number).

Enters the LEA Officer Dashboard in real time with “High Priority” tag.

🔹 Step 2: TRIAGE & DEPLOY – LEA Dashboard Engagement
Officer receives Priya’s report with metadata (location, phone, past patterns).

System automatically:

Checks if the number is linked to an ongoing Kautilya operation.

If YES → links the complaint to that instance.

If NO → officer clicks “Deploy Kautilya 2.0”.

The Officer sees:

Timeline of the complaint.

Previous cases matched to the number.

"Start Hunt" button with MayaJaal integration.

🔹 Step 3: ENGAGE – MayaJaal + Kautilya 2.0
AI persona (via MayaJaal) is generated: e.g., a woman interested in buying.

Kautilya initiates a chat with the scammer using:

Pre-programmed fake identities.

Simulated delay (using time.sleep) for realistic chat feel.

Objective: extract payment instructions (e.g., UPI ID).

🔹 Step 4: EXTRACT & ANALYZE – Scammer DNA Fingerprinting
Scammer responds with fauji47@okbank.

System:

Auto-secures the UPI ID (encrypt + save).

Runs “Scammer DNA” engine:

Links UPI ID to other known virtual numbers, emails, app patterns.

Detects patterns (e.g., same UPI linked to 3 earlier scams).

Dashboard updates with:

Network match data

Heatmap of related cases

Profile of probable scam ring

🔹 Step 5: AUTHORIZE – Vajra (The Hammer)
Officer sees alert:

“HUNT SUCCESSFUL – UPI ID EXTRACTED — MATCHED WITH 3 SCAMS”

Big red button appears: “Authorize Vajra: Scorched Earth Protocol”

Officer must confirm with:

GovCert Login + 2FA + Officer ID

System initiates takedown cascade.

🔹 Step 6: STRIKE & SECURE – Vajra + Akhanda
Vajra sends simulated POST requests (mock API) to payment gateway for takedown.

All linked UPI accounts are "frozen" in the simulation.

Akhanda writes the full trail:

Report received

Hunt initiated

UPI extracted

DNA matched

Officer authorization

Takedown confirmed

Ledger View:

Shows hashes of all actions.

Immutable for evidence.

Displayed in the “Akhanda Ledger Panel” of the Officer UI.
