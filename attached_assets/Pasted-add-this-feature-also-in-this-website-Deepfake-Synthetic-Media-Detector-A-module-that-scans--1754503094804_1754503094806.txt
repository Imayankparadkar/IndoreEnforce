add this feature also in this website :

✅ Deepfake & Synthetic Media Detector

A module that scans uploaded evidence or links for manipulated videos, audio, or images.

If someone sends a threatening video, it auto-checks if it’s AI-generated.

Unique because very few platforms offer this.

✅ Voiceprint Profiling

When victims upload scam call recordings, the system attempts to extract a voiceprint (unique “voice fingerprint”) to cluster calls that likely come from the same scam gang.

✅ Real-Time Scam Call Interruption

If the user is in an active call on the website (VoIP), the AI listens in real-time and interrupts with a spoken warning:

“This call has been identified as a high-probability scam. Please disconnect.”

✅ Conversational AI Negotiator

When scammers interact on chat, the bot can engage them, ask questions, and extract critical metadata (e.g., payment instructions, bank accounts) to aid investigations.

✅ Auto-Generated Legal Notice Draft

After a user submits evidence, the platform can create a pre-filled legal complaint or notice draft in PDF, ready for submission to authorities.

💡 2️⃣ User-Centric Features That Build Trust
These make your platform more friendly and empowering:

✅ Scam Victim Support Chat

An in-platform anonymous chatroom or AI counselor for emotional support.

E.g., “Talk to someone who understands.”

✅ Awareness Gamification

Mini-games or quizzes that teach users to spot scams.

Example: “Spot the Phish—can you detect the fake link?”

✅ Reputation Score for Phone Numbers

Like Truecaller, but public: every phone number reported gets a dynamic “risk score” visible to all users.

✅ Live Scam Heatmap

A map showing real-time scam reports and alerts in different regions.

Makes the platform feel dynamic and relevant.

💡 3️⃣ Enforcement/Operational Superpowers
These help law enforcement work faster:

✅ Auto-Triage Prioritization Engine

AI model scores incoming reports by severity, likelihood of success, urgency (e.g., child exploitation, large money fraud).

✅ Cross-Platform Profile Linking

If a scammer uses multiple usernames or numbers, the system auto-links them into one suspect profile.

✅ Automated Data Requests

System can auto-draft requests to telecom providers or hosting companies for information, saving officers hours of work.

✅ Evidence Tamper-Proofing

Each upload gets an instant blockchain timestamp, proving it was not altered after submission.
